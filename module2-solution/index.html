			<h2>CRICKET</h2>
			<P>
				Cricket is a bat and ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at centre of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at eack end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit bythe bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten players have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and a match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.

			<h2>FOOTBALL</h2>
			<P>
				Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football; and Gaelic football. These various forms of football are known as football codes.
				There are number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world. Contimporary codes of football can be traced back to the condification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century. The expansion of British Empire allowed these rules of football .

			<h2>BADMINTON</h2>
			<p>
				Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.
				Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault ahs been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently form the balls used in many other sports.
